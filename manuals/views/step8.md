Creating a full stack real time mobile app has never been so fast and easy.

And the most important thing - the tools we used (Meteor, Ionic) are good not only for simple use cases but also for a full production scale apps.

You can safely start with those solutions knowing that you won't have to switch to different solutions when your app will scale and add features.

Next steps:

* Check out [meteor.com](meteor.com) for many more resources.
* Go to [angular-meteor.com](angular-meteor.com) and check out the [socially-app tutorial](angular-meteor.com/tutorials/socially/angular2/bootstrapping).
